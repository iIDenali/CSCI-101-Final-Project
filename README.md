# CSCI-101-Final-Project
A program for printing ASCII art.

This program was designed as a final project for my computer science 1 course, as is intended to gather input data and print out ASCII art using it.

The program should first initialize a 2d array with spaces, and then go through a data file and gather each coordinate along with it's corresponding ASCII character. This will then replace any space with said ASCII character in said coordinates. The program should then print out the entire 2d array as an ASCII of block-annotated letters.

Suggestions are welcome and wanted.
